Overview.
</div>

<div class=para1>
  So imagine this, you are the tech person in your family so whenever someone wants to buy a new phone they come to you. You have to tell every single person that picking a phone is like making a sandwich since you can pick and choose what you want. So my idea is a system that chooses the best phone taking in their preferences and requirements in a phone.
</div>

<div class='title4'>
  Motivation.
</div>

<div class=para2>
  My motivation for this idea is that being the tech person in my family and friends people always come to ask what phone they should buy and have no idea what they want so by creating this program this will help those to pick the best phone for them. This will also help people get a bit more knowledgeable about the technology they use as well as make it easier for people to compare phones as soon as they are realized.
  </div>

<div class='title5'>
    Description.
</div>

<div class='para3'>
  My idea consists of a website where a person inputs what their preferences and requirements are in a phone such as company, price and features they have as a requirement and another section in which they can select their preferences. When a person enters their choices and database filters what the devices that are compatible and that fits the personâ€™s preferences best and shows them all the devices that fit their requirements but has the features in their preferences as well. This system will spit out the options in either a table view or a grid view and will allow the user to compare the phones on the website.  There will also be a link to the phoneâ€™s official webpage where they can learn more about the phone. 
<br><br>
I plan to use a simple pastel blue and white palette and some with the font in a black colour and using bold font to make it more noticeable as well using a calibri to show that it is formal.
<br><br>
For features such as the camera I plan to use photos taken on the phone by myself with the photo being standard for every single device so that the customer can see the differences between phones themselves, so for microphones there would be an audio that can be played by the person so that they can see what the microphone is like. The photos and the mic tests would be done using demo models sent in by the company as a part of the content creator program once we grow big enough till then I plan to buy the gadgets myself and hopefully get it put under expenses because if it isnâ€™t it will be very expensive to do this.
<br><br>
I would use Oracle to create the database and it would store the features that a phone has as well as other important information such as the model name and number and the SKU. 
</div>

<div class='title6'>
  Tools and Techniques.
</div>

<div class=para4>
  Tools such as a database can be made using sql or oracle however a server would be necessary to store the data that we have collected for the phones. As well as atom or visual studio code to make the website as well as a platform such as hostgator or godaddy to buy the domain from so that we can make the website live to the public. Tools such as tripods and others would be needed to do the proper testing for the website. 
</div>

<div class='title7'>
  Skills Required.
</div>

<div class='para5'>
  I would need to use skills such as html, css, javascript as well as oracle so that not only can I build the website but also to make the database. I would need software such as vs code or atom so that I can code the website. I would need knowledge so that I can use filters to get results up for the users.
</div>

<div class='title8'>
  Outcome.
</div>

<div class='para6'>
  If this were to become successful a problem for many tech heads of the house would be solved as they can recommend a single link which would solve the problem of so many.
